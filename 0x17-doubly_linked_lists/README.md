# 0x17. C - Doubly linked lists  
## C Algorithm Data structures  
This project is a continuation of our learning of c programming language.  
The project is focused on Data structures in c and we are looking at Doubly linked list as a data strcuture in c  
Doubly linked lists is a data structure holding non-contigious data as nodes, chained together by links/ addresses  
Each node consists of three parts  
- Data part that holds the actual data stored  
- Next part that holds the address of the next node in the list  
- Previous part that holds the address of the node before that one in the list  
The project consists of tasks testing   
-> How to create a doubly linked list  
-> How to insert nodes at beginning, end or any position in the list  
-> How to delete nodes at beginning, end or any position in the list  
-> How to travers a list and print data, count nodes, sum data
