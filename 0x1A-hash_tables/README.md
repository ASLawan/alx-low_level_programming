# 0x1A. C - Hash tables
This project is based on implementation of hash tables in c. Collisions here are handled  
by chaining using linked lists
## Hash Table
A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values. It uses a hash function to map   
keys to a specific index in the hash table array. This allows for efficient insertion,   
deletion, and lookup of key-value pairs.
## Collision
A collision in a hash table occurs when two different keys are mapped to the same   
index in the hash table array. This can happen because hash functions are not   
perfect and can sometimes produce the same output for different input.
### Separate Chaining
This approach creates a linked list at each index in the hash table array.   
When a collision occurs, the new key-value pair is added to the linked   
list at the index where the collision occurred.
### Linear Probing
This approach checks the next index in the hash table array if a collision occurs.   
If the next index is also full, the next index is checked, and so on. This process   
continues until an empty index is found.
## Project Tasks
### Task 0: 
This part of the project simple creates an emtpy hash table.  
### Task 1:
Here, we implemented a functiont that implements the djb2 algorithm.
This part of the project generates the hash that is used in generating indices  
for the has table array.  
### Task 2:
Task two implements a function that generates array indices for the hash table.  
This function works alongside the djb2 functiont to get the indices.  
### Task 3:
Here, we have a function that populates the empty hash table created in task 0 above.  
This function adds elements to the hash table using the index generated by funcion   
in task 2.
### Task 4:
In task 4, we implement a function that is able to retrieve data correspong to a given  
 key using its index on the array. It basically retrieves value for a given element   
int he hash table.
### Task 5:
Here, we want to see the content of the hash table. We have implemented a function   
that prints out the the entire hash table.
### Task 6:
Task 6 implements a function the deletes the hash table.
